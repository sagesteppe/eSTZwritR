A data frame/tibble/sf with 3 rows and 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{REG_NUM}{Region number}
\item{REG_NAME}{Region name}
\item{REG_ABB}{Unofficial 2-3-letter region abbreviation}
\item{geometry}{sf geometry column}
}

\description{
This data set contains the, slightly simplified, 12 department of interior regions.
These data are simplified to save disk space, and for use with cartographic not for purposes of analysis, except for region coding.
They are imported directly and silently by the \code{regionCoding} function to determine which geographic areas to append to a file name.
These data are sourced from the US Department of Interior (DOI) \url{https://www.doi.gov/employees/reorg/unified-regional-boundaries}.
However, the 'REB_ABB' variable, which is ultimately used by eSTZwritR, is derived here and is not an officially sanctioned abbreviation by the USDOI.
