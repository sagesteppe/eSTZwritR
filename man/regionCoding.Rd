\title{Determine which interior regions the STZ should be marked with}
\usage{
regionCoding(x, n, regions)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an empirical STZ as vector data.}

\item{n}{a sample size for determining which interior regions cover the most area of the stz
defaults to 1000, sizes above a couple thousand seem gratuitous.}

\item{regions}{an sf object of regions to use the names of.
If not provided the function will read in a default set.
Note that the sf object must have a column named 'REG_ABB' containing the region abbreviations.}
}
\value{
a list with a vector and a dataframe. The vector lists this component of the filename, at most
two interior regions separated by a '-'.
The dataframe contains a count of the number of randomly drawn points which intersect
interior regions. For areas with near ties we recommend increasing the sample size argument, \code{n} which is paseed to
to st:sample.
}
\description{
This function helps determine which Interior Regions coincide with the majority
of an empirical seed transfer zone and should be used for naming the file.

acth7 <- sf::st_read(file.path(

rc$RegionsCovered # number of random points in each DOI region
