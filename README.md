# Description

An R package for applying standardized file naming, directory structure,
mapping, for empirical Seed Transfer Zones (eSTZs) in the United States.

## Overview

The goal of this package is to standardize eSTZ documentation to
streamline the sharing of these resources among natural resource
professionals, and for researchers to be able to collectively utilize
the products.

## :arrow_double_down: Installation

eSTZwritR is available only on github, with no plans for submission to
CRAN. It can be installed using `remotes` or `devtools` (or `pak` etc.)
like so:

    install.packages('devtools')
    devtools::install_github('sagesteppe/eSTZwritR')

It relies on `sf` which on occasion can be difficult to install. If you
have install problems (read them…), but `sf` is a likely culprit as it
requires several external binaries and libraries.

Once installed it can be attached for use like any other package from
github or CRAN

    library(eSTZwritR)

## Usage

eSTZwritR requires only five user-facing functions to implement all data
sharing conventions.

| Function | Purpose | Output |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `regionCoding` | determine DOI Regions | Character string for file naming |
| `dirmakR` | create Directory | Directory, spatial data |
| `mapmakR` | create Map | PDF or png map (for publications) |
| `fieldsmakR` | ensure fields (columns) are named | sf object to local location |
| `orderZones` | ordering seed zone numbers | updated vector data, plot, summary |

## Documentation

A paper describing the impetus behind the creation of eSTZwritR, and
broadly outlining it’s functionality is available
[here](https://github.com/sagesteppe/EmpiricalSeedZones/blob/main/manuscript/Empirical-seed-transfer-zones-require-conventions-for-data-sharing-to-increase-their-utilization-by-practitioners.pdf).
Note that as of April 1 2025, this paper is in revision for publication
in *Restoration Ecology*.

A poster on the project for the National Native Seed Conference 2025 is
below. It contains all of the proposed conventions, it is also located
in the ./man/figures subdirectory, where you can download a high
resolution copy and zoom in on it.

A vignette showcasing the usage of the package is available
[here](https://sagesteppe.github.io/eSTZwritR/articles/eSTZwritR.html).
This vignette includes the images in the ‘Suggestions’ portion of the
above poster in the relevant areas so you can get a better idea of
specific suggestions (most of which are not included in the text
portions of the manuscript.)
