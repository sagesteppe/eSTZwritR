# eSTZwritR ('easy rider') <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" />

An R package for applying standardized file naming, directory structure, mapping, for empirical Seed Transfer Zones (eSTZs) in the United States. 

## Overview
The goal of this package is to standardize eSTZ documentation to streamline the sharing of these resources among natural resource professionals, and for researchers to be able to collectively utilize the products. 

## Installation
eSTZwritR is available only on github, with no plans for submission to CRAN. 
It can be installed using `remotes` or `devtools` (or `pak` etc.) like so:

```
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('sagesteppe/eSTZwritR')
```

It relies on `sf` which on occasion can be difficult to install. 
If you have install problems (read them...), but `sf` is a likely culprit as it requires several external binaries and libraries. 

Once installed it can be attached for use like any other package from github or CRAN

```
library(eSTZwritR)
```

## Usage  
eSTZwritR requires only five user-facing functions to implement all data sharing conventions. 

|         Function        |         Purpose                   |              Output                 |
|  :-------------------:  | :----------------------------:    | :--------------------------------:  |
|      `regionCoding`     | determine DOI Regions             | Character string for file naming    | 
|        `dirmakR`        | create Directory                  | Directory, spatial data             |             
|        `mapmakR`        | create Map                        | PDF or png map (for publications)   |  
|      `fieldsmakR`       | ensure fields (columns) are named | sf object to local location         | 
|      `orderZones`       | ordering seed zone numbers        | updated vector data, plot, summary  | 
   
## Documentation  
A paper describing the impetus behind the creation of eSTZwritR, and broadly outlining it's functionality is available [here](https://github.com/sagesteppe/EmpiricalSeedZones/blob/main/manuscript/Empirical-seed-transfer-zones-require-conventions-for-data-sharing-to-increase-their-utilization-by-practitioners.pdf). 

A poster on the project for the National Native Seed Conference 2025 is below. 
It contains all of the proposed conventions, it is also located in the ./man/figures subdirectory, where you can download a high resolution copy and zoom in on it.

A vignette showcasing the usage of the package is available [here](https://sagesteppe.github.io/eSTZwritR/articles/eSTZwritR.html). 
This vignette includes the images in the 'Suggestions' portion of the above poster in the relevant areas so you can get a better idea of specific suggestions (most of which are not included in the text portions of the manuscript.)
